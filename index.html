<h2>About Me</h2>

<p1>I have an eye for data want to see what analysis of it will look like.
The amount of things you can do with both valuable data and data others don't believe valuable
is incredible and always keeps me searching for more. I enjoy solving
all kinds of problems and working with others to make great things that make our world easier.

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3><b>Graphing Consumer Complaints</b></h3>
<p2>Uses python with the pandas, matplotlib and requests modules I got 6 million lines of consumer complaint data
from data.gov and graphed it on a map of the U.S. by per capita complaints.
Some challenges in this project was working with a "relatively" large data set of 1.1GB
and mapping out the data as this was the first time I had graphed on a map.

<h3><b>Zoomberg Terminal</b></h3>

<p>This was a fun project for a visualization competition, did not win but learned
a lot in its creation. Scraped stock data and plotted multiple stocks on a line plot as well as plotting
multiple stocks in a 3d view. This project was definitely difficult as working with 3d is always more 
complicated. Most of the difficulties here were with learning a new gui library, DearPyGui,
for this project.

<h3><b>Pathfinding Visualization</b></h3>
<p>Using the pygame game engine I created a pathfinding algorithm visualization that allows 
you to draw your own maze for the computer to solve.

<h3><b>Life of Conway</b></h3>
<p>Used the framework that I made for the pathfinding visualization in order to create 
Conway's Game of Life in pygame.
