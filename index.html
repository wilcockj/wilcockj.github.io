<h2>About Me</h2>

<p1>I have an eye for data and seeing what various aspects of it will look like.
The amount of things you can do with both valuable data and data others don't believe valuable
is incredible and always keeps me searching for more. I enjoy problem solving, hiking, rock climbing, 
playing soccer and working with others to make great things that make our world easier.

<h3>Projects</h3>
<h4>Graphing Consumer Complaints</h4>
<p2>Uses pandas, matplotlib, requests to get 6 million lines of consumer complaint data
and graphs it on a map of the U.S. by per capita complaints.
Some challenges in this project was working with a "relatively" large data set of 1.1GB
and mapping out the data as this was the first time I had graphed on a map.

<h4>Zoomberg Terminal</h4>

<p>This was a fun project for a visualization competition, did not win but learned
a lot in its creation. Scraped stock data and plotted multiple stocks on a line plot as well as plotting
multiple stocks in a 3d view. This project was definitely difficult as working with 3d is always more 
complicated. Most of the difficulties here were with learning a new gui library, DearPyGui,
for this project.
